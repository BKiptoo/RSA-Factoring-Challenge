# RSA Factoring Challenge

This repository contains a Python script for factoring a given number `n` into its prime factors using the Pollard's Rho algorithm. The goal is to efficiently find the prime factors of the input number.

## Usage

To factorize a number `n`, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Run the `rsa.py` script with a single number as an argument to factorize it:

   ```bash
   python rsa.py 77
   ```

4. The script will use the Pollard's Rho algorithm to find the prime factors of the input number and display the result.

## Example

Suppose you want to factorize the number 77. You can run the script as follows:

```bash
python rsa.py 77
```

The script will output:

```
77 = 11 * 7
```
